            The computation part of this project involves a data pipeline to observe similarity within the set of
            antibodies and target the most representative sequences. The first step of the pipeline is to embed 7-letter
            phage sequences into numerical values. We observed that biological sequences, just like a lot of other
            natural sequences, can be seen as complex genetic languages that resemble human language nicely. One can
            draw such analogy that the information contained in a biological sequence is similar to the semantic
            information contained in words. Thus from a language processing perspective, if properly segmented and
            tokenized, the information contained within biological sequences such as structure, folding and interaction
            can be represented as vectors of proper dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We train a SentencePiece model to segment the sequences to individual “words” and create a vocabulary set.
            We do this by first creating a seed vocabulary set then finding the best word segmentation sequence by
            maximizing the probability of a segmentation sequence which is the product of word occurrence probabilities.
            We then find the best vocabulary set by computing loss change in terms of marginal likelihood across the
            entire corpus. After properly segmenting the corpus, we are ready to embed each word to a word vector. The
            approach we adapted is the classical word2vec skip-gram model in language processing. The model is trained
            by predicting words surrounding a central word and thus obtaining a weight matrix W which is the
            representation of all the words. We limit the dimension of the vector representation to 100 which is the
            default value suggested by the author of the word2vec model.
        </p>
        <p>
            After obtaining the embedded vectors, we show the similarity between sequences with clustering. Due to the
            high dimensionality of the data, a dimensional reduction algorithm is necessary to reduce the data to a
            viable dimension for clustering. In high dimensional datasets, distance-based methods such as K-means
            clustering often perform poorly due to the non-preservative nature of l2 norm distance in high dimensional
            euclidean spaces. Therefore, we choose the combination of hierarchy-based clustering and density-based
            clustering to ensure clustering quality. At the same time, the choice of dimensional reduction algorithm is
            also non-trivial. Powerful visualization methods such as regular t-SNE cannot be used due to the large
            amount of data (>= 999999) in the dataset since due to high runtime. We would, however, attempt variations
            of the t-SNE method (for example, ft-SNE which is t-SNE method with interpolation and fast Fourier
            transformation might be significantly faster than regular t-SNE), but since we’re using density-based
            clustering methods, the fact that t-SNE does not preserve distance and density information is fatal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final choice is UMAP enhanced HDBSCAN clustering. UMAP allows tighter packaging of data (which
            highlights density information) and further inter-cluster distance (which highlights hierarchy information).
            HDBSCAN does not require a priori information on cluster number. It also combined the benefits of
            hierarchical-based clustering and density-based clustering thus is the optimal choice.
