# Alaive Wiki

Project website/wiki for UC San Diego's team at iGEM 2019.

Nothing super technical here. I took on this project when a friend of mine asked me to build a website for his iGEM team. Amidst midterm season and with the deadline in less than a week, I accepted the task.

iGEM's online website editing tool was not developer-friendly at all. Almost half of my time was spent hacking the CSS of the default page to make it look nice (aka. make my website span the viewport width like what a normal website would do).

Perhaps this project demonstrates that I can work under harsh dev environments and time constraints. All in all: Anything for the brothers! ðŸ’ª
